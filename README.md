# Maths Problems
After doing my masters in Maths, then becoming a web developer, I wanted to combine my skills to create solutions to the problems I solved during my degree using the new programming skills I have aquired.

## Running the site
I have used node packages to create my site, and use react and sass.
To start the site :
```npm run start```

To update the scss you will need to run the scss build:
```npm run build-css```

Or to continually edit the css you can run the watcher:
```npm run watch-css```
