# Maths Problems
After doing my masters in Maths, then becoming a web developer, I wanted to combine my skills to create solutions to the problems I solved during my degree using the new programming skills I have aquired.

## Running the site

### Main website
I have used node packages to create my site, and use react and sass.

To start the site :
```npm install && npm run start```

To update the scss you will need to run the scss build:
```npm run build-css```

Or to continually edit the css you can run the watcher:
```npm run watch-css```

### Ruby
I have also created a ruby file to practise using ruby. This just has the original travelling salesman problem coded and solved.

To run the ruby file:
```cd src/ruby/```

```ruby travelling-salesman.rb```
